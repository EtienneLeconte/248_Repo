## Project Description

Geoffroy and I decided to build a Risk simulation, based on the real rules of the famous board game. 

## Rules

The world is yours to take. Dispatch your army on your territories and organize yourself wisely to conquer a maximum of territories.

The combat rules are based on dice rolls. Each best dices are compared and the loser loses a soldier in the country under attack. When he doesn't have any more soldiers, the territory is lost to the attacker. 

## Workflow

1. We pseudo-coded the game together 
2. Geoffroy created the main function, the attack function
3. I created the frame: continents, countries, borders, players and armies.
4. We tested it, and went through error handling processes 

## Organization

How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?

As we were physically together, we each coded our part after agreeing on variables and attributes names, then we grouped our lines and tested it together 

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

We both forked the initial 248_Repo and both stored the only file on our forked repository.
